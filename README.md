Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a first-year college student and a beginner Python coder.
ðŸ“š About Me
I'm a passionate and curious first-year college student diving into the world of programming. My journey has just begun, and I'm excited to learn and build new things. My primary focus is Python, where I'm honing my skills in creating practical and fun applications.

ðŸš€ My Projects
Here are a couple of projects I've built to get a feel for Python:

PyQuest: A Text-Based RPG
A simple, interactive game where you make choices to navigate through a story and do quests. This project also features dynamic NPC dialogues generated using the Gemini API, which helped me understand concepts like loops, conditional statements, and functions, as well as API integration.

NewsScraper: A Simple News Fetcher
A script that pulls the latest headlines from a news website. This project introduced me to web scraping and working with external libraries.

ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning
I'm currently exploring new Python libraries and frameworks to expand my skills. I'm especially interested in data analysis and building more interactive, text-based applications. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to collaborate!
